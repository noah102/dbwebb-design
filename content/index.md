Hello!
==========================

My name is Noah I live in Sweden, Dalarna in a small village called Djurmo.
I have a big passion for music and it is what I do most of the time.
Earlier this year I lived in Spain and took a couple long distance courses.
One of them was a beginner web development course and I became very interested and
decided to apply for this course as I would love to work as a web developer as it seems like a very creative job
where the art is in creating websites that people love. I'm very excited for this particular course because it is design and look forward to getting further into it!
